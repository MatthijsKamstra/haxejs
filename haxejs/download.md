# Install Haxe

Before you can use there are a couple of thing you need to do.

Obviously you need to install Haxe. There are a [couple of ways to do it](../haxe/installation.md), but in this document I will send you to the [official place](#haxe).

And a [code editor](#ide) will be useful!

----

Current Haxe version is (at the time of writing):

* **Haxe** v3.4.4

But if the version numbers changed, it means I haven't updated this part of the document in some time :D

## Download Haxe

* Get your version here: [http://haxe.org/download/](http://haxe.org/download/)

## Code Editors

You can find a extensive list on [http://haxe.org/](http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/editors-and-ides.html).
And even a bigger list on the [old website](http://old.haxe.org/com/ide)...

(And I see no mentioning of Atom and Brackets.... even more choices)

**But to keep everything simple**

### On Windows

Install [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/)

### On everything else

Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Haxe Extension Pack ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vshaxe.haxe-extension-pack).

### Okay these two are also good for all platforms

Install [Sublimetext 2](http://sublimetext.com/) with the [haxe sublime2 bundle](https://github.com/clemos/haxe-sublime2-bundle).

It's freakish difficult to setup a project, but after that AWESOME!
[IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with [Haxe support plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6873)
