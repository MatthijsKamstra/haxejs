# Copy & paste

I sometime just need to test something quickly.
And so I `copy & paste` an example from internet.

This is usually doesn't work out of the box...
But I have some tips and tricks to get this working.

## debuggin aka console.log

In Haxe you usually use the Haxe specific way of logging: `trace()`

But you can always use the platform specific way.
In the case of JavaScript:

```js
console.log("test");
```

A handy shortcut for `console.log` is in package [js.Browser](http://api.haxe.org/js/Browser.html#console)

So you could rewrite everything to that:

```haxe
// console.log('foo');
js.Browser.console.log('foo');
```

But it's _MUCH_ easier to add it to you imports

```haxe
import js.Browser.console; 	// if you only want to use console.log
import js.Browser.*; 		// if you also want to use window, document, alert, etc

```

and then your `console.log` will just work without any changes to the copied code

## document, window, console, location

Pretty much the same as previous example.
This is easily fixed with the correct import:

```haxe
import js.Browser.*;
```

And then a simple VanillaJS example works out of the box.

```haxe
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
	console.log("VanillaJs DOM ready");
	trace('host: ', location.host);
});
```

## jQuery

Haxe has [jQuery](http://api.haxe.org/js/JQuery.html) externs embedded in the compiler, but there are some differences using it.

For a typical JS starting point with jQuery, you write:

```js
$(function() {
  //do your magic
});
```

You probably don't realise it but it's a short-hand that bind your magic codes to the document ready event, same as if you write:

```js
$(document).ready(function() {
  //do your magic
});
```

Both will result in `Unknown identifier : $`

So both code-examples won't work in Haxe, because Haxe does not allow using `$` as a class name or a function name.
But `$` is just a short-hand to jQuery so we should be able to fix that.... except...
Haxe requires all class names start with capital letter, so it is `JQuery` in Haxe and not `jQuery`.

You start your Haxe/JS codes using the jQuery extern as following:

```haxe
import js.jquery.JQuery;

class Main {
    static public function main():Void {
        new JQuery(function():Void { //when document is ready
            //your magic
        });
    }
}
```

So in short: you replace `$( ... )` with `new JQuery( ... )`, `import js.jquery.JQuery;` and it will work.

For more examples check the chapter [jQuery](../01jquery/example.md).

## for loop

Okay this thing will not work!

**JavaScript** uses a classic C-style for-loop

```js
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

**Haxe** uses a iterator based for-loop
You will have to change that to:

```haxe
for (i in 0...100) {
	console.log(i);
}
```

For more examples check [cheatsheet.html#loops](https://matthijskamstra.github.io/haxejs/haxejs/cheatsheet.html#loops).

## imports

Mostly its just search where the packages are located
Its to difficult to get you out off all your copy pasting, but for example:

```js
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
```

works with the correct import

```haxe
import js.html.XMLHttpRequest;
```

Sometimes you just need to add `new`:

```js
reject(Error(req.statusText));
```

doesn't work, even if you have imported the correct package

```haxe
import js.Error;
```

just call the constructor:

```haxe
reject(new Error(req.statusText));
```

## Date

Most copy paste stuff is easy fixed, so is this one.
But the solution has something to do with a different language decision.

In Haxe you will create a [date](http://api.haxe.org/Date.html) with `new Date(year, month, day, hour, min, sec)`
In JS it will return the current date

```js
new Date();
```

So use this in Haxe, this will return the current date.

```haxe
Date.now();
```

## setInterval

Repeating calls are create with `setInterval` in JS.

```js
var timer = setInterval(function() {
  // do something
}, 1000);

// clearInterval(timer); // stop interval
```

But with this code the compiler will complain: `Unknown identifier : setInterval`

You can replace this with the default Haxe `Timer` methode.

```haxe
var timer = new haxe.Timer(1000); // 1000ms delay
timer.run = function() {
  // do something
};

// timer.stop(); // stop interval
```

For some reason I usually use the "dirty" solution: use `untyped`

```haxe
var timer = untyped setInterval(function () {
  // do something
}, 1000);


// untyped clearInterval(timer); // stop interval
```

But I shouldn't learn bad stuff, so this is the official Haxe solution:

```haxe
var timer = js.Browser.window.setInterval(function () {
  // do something
}, 1000);


// js.Browser.window.clearInterval(timer); // stop interval
```

## setTimeout

Delayed calls are create with `setTimeout` in JS.

```js
setTimeout(function() {
  // do something
}, 5000);
```

But with this code the compiler will complain: `Unknown identifier : setTimeout`

You can replace this with the default Haxe `Timer.delay` methode.

```haxe
haxe.Timer.delay(function() {
  // do something
}, 5000);
```

For some reason I usually use the "dirty" solution: use `untyped`

```haxe
untyped setTimeout(function () {
  // do something
}, 5000);
```

But I shouldn't learn bad stuff, so this is the official Haxe solution:

```haxe
js.Browser.window.setTimeout(function () {
  // do something
}, 5000);
```

## ;

Okay .... Stupid but JavaScript is more flexible with this.
Just follow the instructions from the Haxe compiler.

## Start document

Okay maybe a little much but I use this example / test document a lot...
Perhaps someone has some use for it.

`Main.hx`

```haxe
package ;

import js.Browser.*;

class Main
{
	function new() {
		trace('Example');
	}


	static public function main(){
		var main = new Main();
	}
}

```

`build.hxml`

```
-cp src
-main Main
-js bin/example.js
-D source-map-content
-debug
-dce full
```
