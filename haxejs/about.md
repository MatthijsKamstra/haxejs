# About haxejs (Haxe and JavaScript)

![Haxe logo](../img/haxe_javascript_logos.png)

JavaScript is **one** of the targets you can use when you work with [Haxe](http://haxe.org/).
And JavaScript is becoming one of the most powerful and [popular](https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github) languages you can learn.

You may say the (Haxe) documentation about the JavaScript target is **very** big.

**Well, you guessed it, it's not.**   
The information is scattered across the web on blogs, forums, tweets, etc.

I can bitch about it, or do something about it... I choose the second.

There used to be a website (an old one, from when Haxe spelled "haXe") that got you started.But that website is no more.  I decided to get some of that back. This documentation is based upon the information from the old site and my own need to document Haxe. I started with the information from the old site. A simple copy, paste. Most of the content of this site/book is from different sources (with permission of the writers). Eventually (that means in the future) I will rewrite it (or not).

The JavaScript documentation was not what I wanted to document; I started with [HaxeNode](http://matthijskamstra.github.io/haxenode/).  **But what is node.js without JavaScript!**

The rewrite will focus on getting the old information/tutorials updated to current use of Haxe and JavaScript.  
*And more motivational gif :D !*
