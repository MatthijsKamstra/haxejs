# About haxejs (Haxe and Javascript)

![Haxe logo](../img/haxe_javascript_logos.png)

Javascript is **one** of the targets you can use when you work with [Haxe](http://haxe.org/).
And JavaScript is becoming one of the most powerful and [popular](https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github) languages you can learn.

So you would say the (Haxe) documentation about the JavaScript target would we very big.

**Well, you guessed it, it's not.**   
The information you can find is scattered across the web on blogs, forums, tweets, etc.

I can bitch about it, or do something about it... I choose the second.

----

There used to be a website (really old, when Haxe was spelled "haXe") that got you started.

But that is no more. So I decided to get some of that back.

---

I started with the information from the old site. A simple copy, paste. Most of the content of this site/book is from different sources (with permission of the writers). Eventually (that means in the future) I will rewrite it (or not).
 
The JavaScript documentation was not really what I wanted to document; I started with [HaxeNode](http://matthijskamstra.github.io/haxenode/).  
**But what is node.js without JavaScript!**

The rewrite will focus on getting the old information/tutorials updated to current use of Haxe and Javascript.  
*And more motivational gif :D !*
