Hello world is the first thing you will write in a new language.

> A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs "Hello, World!" (or some variant thereof) on a display device. Because it is typically one of the simplest programs possible in most programming languages, it is by tradition often used to illustrate to beginners the most basic syntax of a programming language. It is also used to verify that a language or system is operating correctly.

If you did the [Haxe basics](../haxe/hello-world.md) you already did a "Hello World".
This one is a little more structured and more commented!
