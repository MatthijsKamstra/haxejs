#Contribute!

I wanted to make contributing to this documentation as easy as possible.  
That's why I use Markdown. Developers use it, but is just writing in plane English so **everybody** can write documentation!  
And this documentation hosted on Github, developers favorite place to store code.  
Even if you are not a developer. Don't want to clone everything, you still can change the files on the website (you need account to login in and change the `.md` files).
And as a final resort, you can leave your comments/suggestions/etc at the bottom of the page via Disqus.


##### Visit [https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs) to modify the "source" aka markdown files.

## Why?

> Why start another place for Haxe and JavaScript documentation?

There are a couple places you can go for "how to start with ...":   

1. [http://haxe.org/manual/target-javascript.html](http://haxe.org/manual/target-javascript.html) 
2. [http://www.haxejs.com/](http://www.haxejs.com/)
3. different blog posts from individual developers

And they are good.... but:

1. very basic, one example, quickly in-depth
2. difficult to contribute (ownership)
3. all over the place

**So what can be improved:**

1. Add more simple, easy to start with examples
	* simple how to start with Haxe
	* simple and basic code examples
	* how to use jQuery (no JavaScript without jQuery)
	* move slowly to more difficult examples
	* I don't mind copy/paste examples (see point 3, but with permission of the writer if its done in a post) 
2. Make contributing as-easy-as-possible
	* I hope Markdown will help with the writing
	* I hope Github will help with contributing/easy access
	* And exporting to static html is not necessary if you are not up for that (I guess that I will do that)
3. One place for code and website hosting 
	* I hope the `gh-pages` will be *THE* place to go to for more info



## Structure

Every new tutorial should have:

```
+ foldername (use common sense)
	+ code (folder with code examples)
	|	+ bin
	|	+ src
	|	|	- Main.hx
	|	- javascript.hxml
	- about.md (short description what it will do)
	- install.md (is there something you need to install)
	- example.md (javscript.hxml, Main.hx, how to build, etc)

```


## Open-sourcing the documentation

I thought I was the first to try to write documentation this way, but others beat me.  
Although my idea was formed by writing a book in Markdown (Gitbook, but there are others).
Writing documentation is very similar to writing a book.

**Other clever developers who had this idea before me:**  

* [babylon js open sourcing the documentation](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eternalcoding/archive/2015/08/11/babylon-js-open-sourcing-the-documentation.aspx)
* [building markdown based developer docs](https://medium.com/code-stories/building-markdown-based-developer-docs-87c0317c56f7)


## I want to be positive, but internet says differently...

If you got to this part of the contribute file, *GREAT*!  
Although I hope this project will run on contributions of other, the internet is kinda negative about it...

It seems that I am on of the **1%**!
