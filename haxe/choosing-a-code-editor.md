# Choosing a Code Editor

Once Haxe has been [installed](installation.md) (yes you should do that first!). It is helpful to choose an integrated development environment (IDE), with good support for Haxe development.

Although you can write code using even a simple text editor.
A quality IDE can provide:

- code completion (code hints)
- shortcuts to build and test your projects
- and other tools to give you a great coding experience.


## Visual Studio Code

Code is the recommended editor to get started with Haxe, and is the current main effort from the Haxe Foundation.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Build and debug modern web and cloud applications.

Code is free and open-source, and cross platform - Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.


## HaxeDevelop

[HaxeDevelop](http://www.haxedevelop.org) is one of the strongest IDEs for large scale Haxe development.
If you are a Windows user (and perhaps if you are not), we recommend that you try HaxeDevelop first.

HaxeDevelop is free and open-source.


## IntelliJ IDEA

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is primarily marketed as a Java IDE. But it has a growing support within the Haxe community, and is prefered by large teams. The full edition and the free community edition, support the open-source [Haxe plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6873?pr=idea).


## Other Choices

There are other code editors to choose from, include vim and up-and-coming Haxe-based editors. You can read more at [http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/editors-and-ides.html](http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/editors-and-ides.html)
