# Choosing a Code Editor




Once Haxe has been [installed](installation.md) (yes you should do that first!). It is helpful to choose an integrated development environment (IDE), with good support for Haxe and OpenFL development.

Although you can write code using even a simple text editor.
A quality IDE can provide:

- code completion (code hints)
- shortcuts to build and test your projects
- and other tools to give you a great coding experience.

## HaxeDevelop

[HaxeDevelop](http://www.haxedevelop.org) is one of the strongest IDEs for Haxe development. If you are a Windows user (and perhaps if you are not), we recommend that you try HaxeDevelop first.
HaxeDevelop is a great developer IDE with:

- integrated source-control support (svn, git, mercurial)
- tasks/todo, snippets
- plugin support
- XML/HTML/CSS completion
- built-in zen-coding for HTML

Haxe developers prefer HaxeDevelop.

HaxeDevelop is free and open-source.

## Visual Studio Code

![Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/home/home-screenshot-mac-lg.png)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Build and debug modern web and cloud applications. Code is free and available on your favourite platform - Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.


## Sublime Text

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) is a code editor, with support for Haxe using the [Haxe Sublime Bundle](https://github.com/clemos/haxe-sublime-bundle). Sublime Text is cross-platform, with support for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Sublime Text does not provide accurate code completion. Nor does it support "projects" in the traditional IDE sense. But, yet, Sublime Text is much stronger than a simple text editor, and is a good recommendation for Mac and Linux users.

Sublime Text is free-to-use, with reminders to pay for continued use.

## IntelliJ IDEA

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is primarily marketed as a Java IDE. But it has growing support within the Haxe community, including large teams, such as TiVo. The full edition and the free community edition, support the [Haxe plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6873?pr=idea), which is not easy to install. But can provide a fuller native IDE experience for Mac or Linux users.

## Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io/) A hack-able text editor for the 21st Century.

> Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the coreâ€”a tool you can customise to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.



## Brackets

[Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is a lightweight, yet powerful, modern text editor. We blend visual tools into the editor so you get the right amount of help when you want it.







## Other Choices

There are other code editors to choose from, include vim and up-and-coming Haxe-based editors. You can read more at [http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/editors-and-ides.html](http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/editors-and-ides.html)
