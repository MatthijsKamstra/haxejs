> Talk description: in this talk “A walk-through of Haxe JS Kit”, Clément Charmet demonstrates the main features of Haxe JS Kit, and through them, the huge benefits of using Haxe over alternatives such as Typescript to "just" target JavaScript.

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YgbxqFx9qak/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgbxqFx9qak)

> Talk description: David Mouton presents “NPM, Haxe at the heart of JavaScript ecosystem”. JavaScript ecosystem for web app development is well implanted and NPM is at the centre of it. Coffeescript and Typescript are perfectly integrated and have offered a real alternative to full JavaScript development. For almost a year now, Haxe has constituted a third alternative in this ecosystem.


#### Haxe, a language that compiles to JS

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/7YNR9HAm6D0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YNR9HAm6D0)

> Nowadays there are a lot of languages that are able to compile to JS (e.g. Dart, TypeScript, Java/GWT etc.). One that is less well-known, but will surely blow your mind, is Haxe. It is one of the earliest languages that target JS (since 2006). It is a statically-typed language with ECMAScript like syntax.
