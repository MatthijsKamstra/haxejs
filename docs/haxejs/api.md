## Haxe JS API

You can find more information about the core language API, here: [http://api.haxe.org/js/](http://api.haxe.org/js/)

## haxe.org JavaScript

Read more about Haxe and JavaScript in the manual:

## JavaScript?

JavaScript itself is beyond the scope of this resource - it is assumed that you already are familiar with it, and you are here to learn about the Haxe JavaScript target.

The following resources are worth checking out as a refresher:

- <http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/>
- <http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp>
- <https://www.gitbook.com/book/gitbookio/javascript/details>

All you learn from these resources about JavaScript is applicable here!

## JavaScript Externs

Find most of the externs on [haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/).
Check under the tag ["js"](http://lib.haxe.org/t/js/) (not all libs mentioned there are externs). Or ["extern"](http://lib.haxe.org/t/extern) (not all libs mentioned there are js externs)

In general, the API in Haxe will mirror the original API in JavaScript, but sometimes there are minor differences.
If you have any questions, please get in contact with the maintainer of the lib.

#### For example

A popular JavaScript library is pixi.js.

Download the pixi.js extern via:

```
haxelib install pixijs
```

And if you visit the page on [lib.haxe.org](http://lib.haxe.org/p/pixijs/) you can read more about the pixijs extern.
**For example:**

- How to install it (haxelib) where the original open source files located ([github](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-haxe))
