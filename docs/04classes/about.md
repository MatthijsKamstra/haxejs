We talked about how Haxe will make it easier to work with bigger projects.
And I know it's possible with plain JavaScript... but I have never wrapped my head arround it.
It's just a mess.

So in this tutorial no examples how it would be done in plain JavaScript.
If you are really curious about it, just check [example.js](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs/tree/master/docs/02dom/code/bin/example.js) which is the compiled Haxe code.
