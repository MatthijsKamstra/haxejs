# About loading a json

A very common way of loading data in your web-app is the use of `json` files.

Haxe can handle [json](http://api.haxe.org/haxe/Json.html) cross-platform

> Crossplatform JSON API : it will automatically use the optimized native API if available.
> Use `-D haxeJSON` to force usage of the Haxe implementation even if a native API is found. This will provide extra encoding features such as enums (replaced by their index) and StringMaps.


## Test localhost

When you load an example locally (when you test your files on your computer instead of a server) you will get an error message:

```
.... from origin 'file://' has been blocked from loading by Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy: Received an invalid response. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.

```

To fix that you should open your files via localhost.
There are many ways to do it, but I will use the Haxe solution `Nekoserver`.


## Neko Web Server

We will use a rarely mentioned feature from Haxe.

You can run a web-server : [Neko Web Server](http://old.haxe.org/doc/start/neko#using-the-neko-development-webserver-to-serve-http-requests-whose-contents-are-generated-by-haxe)


And the cool part is:
**You don't have to install anything if you already have Haxe installed.**


```
Neko Web Server v1.0 - (c)2006-2013 Haxe Foundation
	Options :
		-p <port> : change server port
		-h <host> : change server host
		-d <dir> : change the server base directory
		-log <file> : set log file
		-rewrite : activate pseudo mod-rewrite for smart urls
```


You need the path to your files (so replace `path/to/files` with your own path)
*example:* `path/to/files/haxejs/07pixi/code/bin/`

```
nekotools server -p 2000 -h localhost -d path/to/files
```

and open your browser to <http://localhost:2000>


You can also start the web-server with it's defaults (port:2000, host:localhost)

```
nekotools server
```

But then you have to visit the configure-page the server by going to <http://localhost:2000/server:config>

(or open your terminal in the correct folder)
