# Loading the Haxe way vs Vanilla JS

In this example we are going to compare the different ways to load data with Haxe and vanilla js.

We saw in a previous example the Haxe way of loading data: [json example](../08json/about.md). We loaded a Json with [`haxe.Http`](http://api.haxe.org/haxe/Http.html). The reason to do so is because this class is accessable in **all** Haxe targets. So eventually you can use it in Node, PHP, JavaScript, etc.
But there might be reasons to use the native version, and with Haxe you can!


Check the [code folder](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs/tree/master/08loading/code) for more comments.

In this example we are going to use VanillaJS and read and use a `.json` file.



## How to start

Create a folder named **foobar** (please use a better name; any name will do) and create folders **bin** and **src**.
See example below:

```
+ foobar
	+ bin
	+ src
		- Main.hx
	- build.hxml
```



## The MainJS.hx

First we will show the vanilla / native JavaScript code, and check out [MainJS.hx](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs/tree/master/08loading/code/MainJS.hx) for the complete code.

Lets isolate the code that does all the work: read more about [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).
And of course you can use Haxe with [XMLHttpRequest](http://api.haxe.org/js/html/XMLHttpRequest.html)

```haxe
	var url = "http://ip.jsontest.com/";
	var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
	req.open('GET', url);
	req.onload = function() {
		var result:IpAddress = haxe.Json.parse(req.response);
		trace('[JS] Your IP-address: ${result.ip}');
	};
	req.onerror = function(error) {
		console.error('[JS] error: $error');
	};
	req.send();
```

In this example we are going to get our ip from <http://ip.jsontest.com/> in JSON.

This little typedef is to extract that data from the response data.

```haxe
typedef IpAddress = { ip:String }
```

Quite simple and the result will return you IP address.

Compare the [Haxe code](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs/tree/master/08loading/code/MainJS.hx) and the [transpiled JavaScript](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs/tree/master/08loading/code/bin/example_js.js) and you will see there is almost no difference!



## The Main.hx

Now lets check out the same example but now with the [`haxe.Http`](http://api.haxe.org/haxe/Http.html) class.

You can find the complete code [here](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs/tree/master/08loading/code/Main.hx)

```haxe
	var url = "http://ip.jsontest.com/";
	var req = new haxe.Http(url);
	req.onData = function (data : String) {
		var result:IpAddress = haxe.Json.parse(data);
		trace('[Haxe] Your IP-address: ${result.ip}');
	};
	req.onError = function (error) {
		console.error('[Haxe] error: $error');
	};
	req.request();
```

The typedef is the same as the one from vanilla JS code.

Quite simple and the result will return you IP address.

Let see the difference between [Haxe Http](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs/tree/master/08loading/code/Main.hx) and [Haxe vanilla JS](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs/tree/master/08loading/code/MainJS.hx), very simular right!

But when you compare the transpiled code from [Haxe code](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs/tree/master/08loading/code/Main.hx) to [example_haxe.js](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxejs/tree/master/08loading/code/bin/example_haxe.js) you might think Haxe is a bad idea.

Remember: if you use a library to load data it will look simular except it will be in an external library not in _your_ code.
And if you prefer that, you can do that with Haxe: check out [Example NASA](../06nasa/about.md) where we use JQuery to load a JSON file.
But any loading lib can be used with [externs](../05externs/about.md) or (if you don't want to write externs) just with `untyped`.

The reason for a longer file is that some features in Haxe are not in JavaScript or are different and so they need to be created. Like `Lambda`, `List`, `EReg` and `Http`. And there something called `IE` that always works different from the rest of the browsers, so that needs to be adressed. No different with other libraries.

But this is a small example, so all that "Haxe" stuff looks HUGE... With a normal code base you will not notice this extra code, better yet I normally don't look at the transpiled code. The dead code elimation (DCE) of Haxe cleans up my code, and once you minify your code nobody wants to read it!.



## The Haxe build file, build.hxml

There are a lot of different arguments that you are able to pass to the Haxe compiler.
These arguments can also be placed into a text file of one per line with the extension hxml. This file can then be passed directly to the Haxe compiler as a build script.

```
# // build.hxml
-cp src
-main Main
-js bin/example.js
-dce full
```

Because we have two files here to export, we just add

```
--next

-cp src
-main MainJS
-js bin/example_js.js
-dce full
```



## Build js with Haxe

To finish and see what we have, build the file and see the result

1. Open your terminal
2. `cd ` to the correct folder where you have saved the `build.hxml`
3. type `haxe build.hxml`
4. press enter
