#About Promise

The Promise object is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never.

[promise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises)

The "promise" variables contain values that are not immediately available. However, you can specify callback functions that will trigger when the values do become available.

There are a couple of haxelibs that do the same, but in this example we will use the default Haxe implemention [js.Promise](http://api.haxe.org/js/Promise.html)
