# Haxe and JavaScript

![Haxe logo](img/haxe_javascript_logos.png)

There used to be a website (an old one, where Haxe was spelled as "haXe") that got you started.

But that website is no more. I had already started with HaxeNode and it seems fitting to also document HaxeJS. I decided to get some of that back.
Based upon the information from the old site and my own needs, I decided to document this.

I hope this will help you. If you think so, why not help with [contribution](contribute.md) to this tutorial site.

### How will this help me?

It will get you started with JavaScript **and** Haxe.
How to setup your project, install externs and how to work with them. This probably will never be a complete documentation but it will help you get started!

### For whom is this?

For clever, cool and handsome developers. Duh! :D

* Probably for JavaScript developers who already started with Haxe.
* Developers who know that JavaScript sucks for bigger projects.
* Developers who have tried CoffeeScript and TypeScript.
* JavaScript developers who write more then a half a dozen classes.
* Flash-developers looking for an AS3 replacement
* Flash-developers starting with JS and trying to compete with plain JS-developers
* Freelance developers working with JS
* Small developers teams working on big projects


## Documentation goals

I wanted to make contributing to this documentation as easy as possible.
That's why I use Markdown. Developers use it, but is just writing in plane English so **everybody** can write documentation!
This documentation hosted on Github - developers' favorite place to store code.
Even if you are not a developer and don't want to clone everything, you still can change the files on the website (you need account to login in and change the `.md` files).
And as a final resort, you can leave your comments/suggestions/etc at the bottom of the page via Disqus.


## Open-sourcing the documentation

I thought I was the first to try to write documentation and open-sourcing it this way, but others beat me.
Although I was already writing everything with markdown, it looked like a good idea to use Gitbook to "publish" it. Writing documentation is like writing a book.

**Other clever developers who had this idea before me:**
