# About VanillaJs


VanillaJS is a name to refer to using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like jQuery. People use it as a joke to remind other developers that many things can be done nowadays without the need for additional JavaScript libraries.

Here's a funny site that jokingly talks about this: [http://vanilla-js.com/](http://vanilla-js.com/)

Okay we have seen the power of jQuery, but more and more developers choose work with the DOM directly.
And when you work with Haxe everything will be awesome.
JavaScript is a strange puppy, and with the help of Haxe you can make sense of it.
When you use jQuery a lot, you don't know what is going on in JavaScript.
So I decide to write a little about this.

**I am not against jQuery, I use it a lot. **

## Article about this subject!

You can't find a lot of information about Haxe and JS.
If you find an article about the subject it's rare.

The first one who wrote about VanillaJS in combination with Haxe is Philippe Elsass (also known as the FlashDevelop guy).
It's an interesting article and I suggest you read it:

This is an awesome document explaining how it works in Haxe.
