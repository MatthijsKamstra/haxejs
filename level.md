#Level of Difficulty 

I thought it would be useful to have some idea what sort of level the examples have here.


How to define your level on a specific topic?

- **Beginner:** No knowledge at all of the topic
- **Basic:** A very basic knowledge of the topic but no professional usage
- **Intermediate:** A basic knowledge of the topic but no regular professional usage
- **Advanced:** A good knowledge of the topic and a regular professional usage
- **Expert:** A perfect knowledge of the topic and a daily professional usage


How does that translate to these examples?

##Beginner
**No knowledge at all of the topic.**  
These examples start with the simplest code. But I don't think you will have any use of these examples without knowledge of Haxe or JavaScript. I suggest you start with the basics of JavaScript and Haxe.
I have a little chapter about [learning Haxe](haxe/learn-haxe.md).


##Basic
**A very basic knowledge of the topic but no professional usage**  

* [Example Hello World](00helloworld/about.md)
* [Example jQuery](01jquery/about.md)
* [Example DOM](02dom/about.md)

##Intermediate
**A basic knowledge of the topic but no regular professional usage**  
http://matthijskamstra.github.io/haxejs/haxe/about.html
* [Example VanillaJS](03vanillajs/about.md)
* [Example Externs](05externs/about.md)
* [Example NASA](06nasa/about.md)


##Advanced
**A good knowledge of the topic and a regular professional usage**  

* [Example pixi.js](07pixi/about.md)
* [Example Json](08json/about.md)
* [Example @:expose](09expose/about.md)


##Expert
**a perfect knowledge of the topic and a daily professional usage**  
Go away, you're done.
