# Level of Difficulty

It is useful to define the complexity level for the examples:

- **Beginner:** No knowledge at all of the topic
- **Basic:** A very basic knowledge of the topic but no professional usage
- **Intermediate:** A basic knowledge of the topic but no regular professional usage
- **Advanced:** A good knowledge of the topic and a regular professional usage
- **Expert:** A perfect knowledge of the topic and a daily professional usage

How does that translate to these examples?

## Beginner

**No knowledge at all of the topic.**

These examples start with the simplest code, but minimal programming experience is expected. At least do an [introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).

## Basic

**A very basic knowledge of the topic but no professional usage**

- [Example Hello World](00helloworld/about.md)
- [Example jQuery](01jquery/about.md)
- [Example DOM](02dom/about.md)
- [Example hxml](20build/about.md)

## Intermediate

**A basic knowledge of the topic but no regular professional usage**

- [Example VanillaJS](03vanillajs/about.md)
- [Example Externs](05externs/about.md)
- [Example NASA](06nasa/about.md)

## Advanced

**A good knowledge of the topic and a regular professional usage**

- [Example pixi.js](07pixi/about.md)
- [Example Json](08json/about.md)
- [Example loading](08loading/about.md)
- [Example @:expose](09expose/about.md)
- [Example automation](12automation/about.md)
- [Example minify](19minify/about.md)

## Expert

**A perfect knowledge of the topic and a daily professional usage**

- [Example macro](13macro/about.md)

Go away, you're done.
